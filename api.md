# Apptentive API (Beta)

## Introduction

The Apptentive API provides programmatic access to the various data set by the Apptentive SDK and associated with a given app. The API is organized around REST, and responses are sent using JSON. All API access is performed over HTTPS/SSL connections with a base endpoint of `https://api.apptentive.com`.

**Please note that the API is currently in beta and subject to change. While the API is in beta, you must request explicitly request your API keys from [support@apptentive.com](mailto:support@apptentive.com).**

## Authentication

Authentication is required for accessing all API endpoints. The Apptentive API uses your API key as an OAuth token, and to authenticate you must provide this token in the Authorization header. For example:

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: OAuth ea0b3686bfadf43245944e841e611c8a7d25cdd21098a9f83c3030553a593a71" https://api.apptentive.com/conversations
```

Please note that the API key used for accessing these endpoints is **different** than the key used with the Apptentive SDK within your app.

## Status & Errors

Standard HTTP Response codes are used to indicate the status of requests. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx indicate an error in the data provided by the client, and codes in 5xx indicate an error on the server.

__Status Code Summary__:

* **200** The request succeeded.
* **201** The request succeeded and an object was created.
* **401** Authentication failed and the request was rejected.
* **403** Authentication succeeded by the request is not permitted and was rejected.
* **404** The requested resource could not be found.
* **422** The request included invalid input and was rejected.  The specific invalid input will be included in the response.
* **500,502,503** There was an internal server error.  You should retry the request at a later date.

## Conversations

The central object for an App is a Conversation. Each Conversation has an associated Person and Device, and provides the context for the messages and other interactions that occur for that given Person on that given device within the given App.

### Retrieving Conversations

A list of all Conversations for the App may be retrieved with a `GET` request to `https://api.apptentive.com/conversations`. For example:

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: OAuth ea0b3686bfadf43245944e841e611c8a7d25cdd21098a9f83c3030553a593a71" https://api.apptentive.com/conversations
```

The response will contain an array of Conversations (in ascending creation order), as well as a flag indicating whether more Conversations are available:

```javascript
{
  "conversations": [{
    "id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004d",
    "person_id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004e",
    "device_id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004f"
  }, {
    "id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004e",
    "person_id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004f",
    "device_id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004b"
  }],
  "has_more": true
}
```

Each Conversation will include the `id` for the Conversation, the `person_id` for the associated Person, and the `device_id` for the associated Device.

Conversations are in one of four possible states:

* **new** indicates that the conversation has been created but has not yet received any messages.
* **open** indicates that the the person associated with the conversation has left a message that has not yet been responded to.
* **waiting** indicates that the person associated with the conversation has been responded to.
* **archived** indicates that the conversation has been archived.

You may optionally filter for conversations in a specific state by including the `state` argument along with a comma-separated list of states to match.  For example, to return all conversations where at least one message has been received:

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: OAuth ea0b3686bfadf43245944e841e611c8a7d25cdd21098a9f83c3030553a593a71" https://api.apptentive.com/conversations?state=open,waiting,archived
```

You may provide two optional arguments to page through the results:

* **skip** indicates the number of Conversations to skip in the results.
* **limit** indicates the number of Conversations to return in the results, with a maximum limit of 50.

### Retrieving a Specific Conversation

A specific Conversation for the App may be retrieved with a `GET` request to  `https://api.apptentive.com/conversations/:id`, replacing `:id` with the appropriate id (e.g. as returned in the API above). For example:

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: OAuth ea0b3686bfadf43245944e841e611c8a7d25cdd21098a9f83c3030553a593a71" https://api.apptentive.com/conversations/5234f08cbca21f834800004d
```

The response will include the `id` for the Conversation, the `person_id` for the associated Person, and the `device_id` for the associated Device:

```javascript
{
  "id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004d",
  "person_id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004e",
  "device_id": "5234f08cbca21f834800004f"
}
```

### Retrieving Messages Associated with a Conversation

All of the Messages associated with a given conversation may be retrieved with a  `GET` request to `https://api.apptentive.com/conversations/:id/messages`, replacing `:id` with the appropriate id (e.g. as returned in the API above). For example:

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: OAuth ea0b3686bfadf43245944e841e611c8a7d25cdd21098a9f83c3030553a593a71" https://api.apptentive.com/conversations/5234f08cbca21f834800004d/messages
```

The response will contain an array of Messages (in ascending creation order), as well as a flag indicating whether more Messages are available:

```javascript
{
  "messages": [{
